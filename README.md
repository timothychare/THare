## Welcome To Tim Hares GitHub Website

I am trying to better learn github and development in general to improve my income and understanding of the world. I am enjoying learning these tools. I have spent a bit of time with Python and now JavaScript because these are two highly regarded languages.

Plus I work as a support Engineer for platforms like GCP, Twilio and Amazon Connect. I want to be more skilled to support my customers as well as impriove my oppertunities into the future.
